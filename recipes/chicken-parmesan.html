    <h1>Rick's Best Chicken Parmesan</h1>
    <img src="img/parmesan.jpg" alt="chicken parmesan plate">
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Crunchy chicken Parmesan that your family will love. 
          Everyone I have made this for has told me it's the best chicken Parmesan ever. 
          Serve over your favorite pasta with your favorite sauce (I use marinara). 
          Sometimes I sprinkle mozzarella cheese over my chicken as well as the Parmesan. 
          I also garnish with chopped fresh basil. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts </li>
          <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
          <li>¼ cup crushed fish-shaped crackers (such as Goldfish®) </li>
          <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided </li>
          <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
          <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
          <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
          <li>2 eggs </li>
          <li>¾ cup vegetable oil </li>
      </ul>      
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
          <li>Combine flour, crackers, 1 1/2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a resealable plastic bag.</li>
          <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl. Dip chicken breasts into eggs to coat; place in flour mixture and seal bag. Toss chicken in the flour mixture until well covered.</li>
          <li>Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add chicken breasts; cook until underside is browned and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip; sprinkle 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese over each chicken breast. Spoon hot oil over cheese until melted. Drain on paper towels for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
